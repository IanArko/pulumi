## Creating your first project:
In pulumi, projects represent the highest level of organization. The information about this project will live in the Pulumi.yaml file. 

To crate your first project, create an empty directory and use the following:
`pulumi new <YOUR STACK OPTIONS>`.

For my first attempt, I'm using:
`pulumi new kubernetes-javascript`
